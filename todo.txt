- Log every call to an endpoint (with user data like ipaddr, hostname, etc.)
- Create directory

- Maybe remove all 'path.to.dir' endpoints (don't like it...)


Eventually maybe file manager using "tags"
	- maybe json files for each image/video containing a location, file info & activity log (like changing the location)
